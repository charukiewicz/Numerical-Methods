This repository is a collection of project files created during the Numerical Methods course at the University of Illinois at Ubrana-Champaign.

Most of the files are designed as standalone programs to perform a specific task or function.  A description of each is available in the comments of each file.

Most of these files also require the numpy and/or matplotlib libraries to run correctly.
